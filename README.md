# Assignment 14 – Feature Engineering and ML Pipelines

This project implements feature engineering, encoding, scaling, and Scikit-learn pipelines using the Titanic dataset as part of Assignment 14. The focus is on data preparation and pipeline design, not model optimization.

## Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic  
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data  
- Target: Survived  
- Contains numerical and categorical features as required.

## Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn

## Tasks Completed
- Created new features (family_size, fare_per_person, age_group, name_length, title)  
- Applied One-Hot Encoding using get_dummies and ColumnTransformer  
- Performed scaling using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler  
- Built preprocessing pipelines for numerical and categorical data  
- Created full ML pipeline with LogisticRegression  
- Split data, trained pipeline, and generated predictions  
- Added conceptual answers on pipeline benefits
